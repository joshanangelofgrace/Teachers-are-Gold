# This removes localization files for regions which you haven't explicitly localized.
# This is mainly to work around a three-factor problem:
# 1) iTunes Connect reads .lproj folders to detect supported languages in an app.
# 2) FormatterKit (and other pods) provides translations for a ton of languages.
# 3) CocoaPods copies all translations from all pods into our app.
# So, iTunes Connect ends up thinking our app supports a lot of languages it doesn't.
# By reading the "knownRegions" property of the pbxproj, we can get the list of
# regions you've actually created a localization for in the project settings.
# See this GitHub issue for details and other workarounds:
# https://github.com/mattt/FormatterKit/issues/88

# This script should be run as a build phase after both the "Copy Bundle Resources"
# and "Copy Pods Resources" phases. It has no input or output files.
