# On Certificates

To facilitate working in a team, please check in the certificates and private keys relevant to this project. This way, new developers can actually build and release the project without spending hours mucking around in the developer portal.

The less spent time in the developer portal, the better.


### So, check in the following:

**From the developer portal:**

1. The development certificate (`ios_development.cer`)
2. The distribution certificate (`ios_distribution.cer`)

**From Keychain Access on your local machine:**

1. Your private key linked to the distribution certificate, exported as a p12 file.
