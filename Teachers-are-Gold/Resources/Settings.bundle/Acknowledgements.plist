From time to time, Crashlytics may solicit from Developer or Developer may make, in its sole discretion, suggestions for changes, modifications or improvements to the Services or any other feedback related to Crashlytics or the Services (collectively, &#8220;Developer Feedback&#8221;). All Developer Feedback shall be solely owned by Crashlytics (including all intellectual property rights therein and thereto) and shall also be Crashlytics&#8217;s confidential information.

Developer may provide Beta Testers with its own EULA for a Beta Application that will be accessed by Beta Testers (&#8220;Developer EULA&#8221;); provided that the Developer EULA provides terms and conditions consistent with the Terms and, with respect to Crashlytics, no less protective than those terms and conditions set forth in the standard EULA provided in Appendix A (&#8220;Standard EULA&#8221;). If Developer does not provide a separate Developer EULA to Beta Testers that is applicable to Developer&#8217;s Beta Application, then Developer acknowledges and agrees that such Beta Testers&#8217; use of the Beta Application shall be subject to the Standard EULA. Developer acknowledges and agrees that Crashlytics provides the Standard EULA by way of convenience only, and does not represent or warrant that the Standard EULA will be enforceable under, or in compliance with, all applicable laws, rules, regulations, or otherwise. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the EULA applicable to Developer&#8217;s Beta Application shall be between Developer and any Beta Tester, and Crashlytics shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever for, such EULA, any application tested by a Beta Tester, or for any breach by Developer or any Beta Tester of the terms and conditions of such EULA.

Developer represents and warrants that Developer is collecting information via the Services solely to obtain information about the user engagement with and functionality of Developer&#8217;s applications, and to communicate with users about such engagement and functionality. Developer agrees that it will not enable collection of personally identifiable information via the Services unless it is necessary to communicate with users about the applications or Developer wishes to invite users to be Beta Testers and the user has provided affirmative consent to the collection and use of such information. Subject to and without limiting the foregoing, Developer agrees it will not enable collection or use of credit card information, Social Security numbers, driver&#8217;s license numbers, dates of birth or physical addresses via the Services. Developer further agrees it will not enable the collection or use of personally identifiable information by way of applications directed at children under 13 via the Services or provide any personally identifiable information collected via such applications to Crashlytics.

Developer shall ensure that Developer Systems are compatible with the Services and comply with all configurations and specifications described in the Documentation.

Limitations. Crashlytics will not be responsible or liable for any failures in the Services or any other problems which are related to (a) the Developer Data or Developer Systems, or (b) any satellite, telecommunications, network or other equipment or service outside of Crashlytics&#8217;s facilities or control.

Confidentiality. &#8220;Confidential Information&#8221; means, with respect to Crashlytics, all financial, business or technical information disclosed by or for Crashlytics in relation to these Terms that is of a nature that should reasonably be considered to be confidential or proprietary. Except for the specific rights granted by these Terms, neither party receiving Confidential Information hereunder (&#8220;Recipient&#8221;) may use, copy or disclose any Confidential Information of the party disclosing Confidential Information hereunder (&#8220;Discloser&#8221;) without Discloser&#8217;s prior written consent, and shall use no less than reasonable care to safeguard Discloser&#8217;s Confidential Information, including ensuring that Recipient&#8217;s employees, contractors and agents (&#8220;Representatives&#8221;) with access to Discloser&#8217;s Confidential Information have a need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of these Terms and are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective of the parties as those set forth herein.

Nothing herein shall prevent a party from disclosing any of the other&#8217;s Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to any court order or any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation; provided, however, prior to any such disclosure, Recipient shall use reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify Discloser in writing of such requirement to disclose, and (b) cooperate with Discloser in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order.

Appendix A - Standard EULA

You, the Beta Tester, and the Developer (&#8220;Licensor&#8221;) of the Beta Application you access and use via the Services agree to comply with the terms of this EULA in connection with your access and use of such Beta Application (the &#8220;Application&#8221;). Relationship between the Parties. Licensor and the Beta Tester acknowledge that this Standard EULA is entered into by and between Licensor and the Beta Tester only, and not with Crashlytics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Twitter, Inc. and its affiliates (&#8220;Crashlytics&#8221;), and Licensor, not Crashlytics, is solely responsible and liable for the Application accessed and used by the Beta Tester, including (i) any related maintenance and support, (ii) any and all express, implied or statutory warranties associated with the Application, and (iii) any disputes or claims arising out of or related to the access and use of the Application.

License. Subject to your compliance with these Standard EULA Terms, the Licensor grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable license to access, download and use the Application and any related documentation made available to you by the Licensor, solely for beta testing purposes. Licensor reserves all right, title and interest in the Application not expressly granted to you, including but not limited to intellectual property rights. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you may not do any of the following with respect to the Application: (a) modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Application; (b) rent, lease, loan, sell, sublicense, distribute, transmit, or otherwise transfer the Application; or (c) make any copy of or otherwise reproduce the Application. This license is effective until terminated by you or the Licensor. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from the Licensor if you fail to comply with any term of this Standard EULA. Upon termination of the license, you shall cease all use of the Application, and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Application.

No Compensation. By becoming a Beta Tester, you are acting as a volunteer. You will bear your own costs, including any mobile carrier and data costs, that you incur in connection with your use of the Application or any User Feedback (defined in Section 2 of the Terms above) that you submit.

User Feedback. You agree to use reasonable efforts to beta test any application downloaded from the Services. User Feedback shall be owned by the Licensor. You hereby assign all of your right, title and interest in and to any User Feedback to Licensor and acknowledge that Licensor has the unrestricted right to use and exploit such User Feedback in any manner, with or without attribution, and without compensation or any duty to account to you for such use.

Confidentiality. The Application and related information that Licensor provides to you are Licensor&#8217;s confidential information. You will not disclose information about the Application or any other Licensor confidential information to anyone other than Licensor&#8217;s employees, unless Licensor gives you written permission. For example, do not share screenshots or video clips of the Application with your friends, family, coworkers or the media. You will also take reasonable precautions to prevent anyone from obtaining Licensor&#8217;s confidential information. For example, you should restrict access to your mobile device, prevent others from watching you use the Application, and not create any screenshots or video clips of the Application.

Disclaimer. THE APPLICATION IS A TEST VERSION THAT IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU FOR TESTING AND EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY. THE APPLICATION IS NOT READY FOR COMMERCIAL RELEASE AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS AND DEFECTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED &#8220;AS IS,&#8221; WITH ALL FAULTS, DEFECTS AND ERRORS, AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. LICENSOR AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, ARISING BY LAW OR OTHERWISE) REGARDING THE APPLICATION AND ITS PERFORMANCE OR SUITABILITY FOR YOUR INTENDED USE, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE (UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY) FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF CONTENT, LOSS OF IN-APPLICATION FEATURES, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLICATION, EVEN IF LICENSOR AND/OR ITS SUPPLIERS HAS/HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, SO THESE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR AND ITS SUPPLIERS&#8217; AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING FROM YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLICATION EXCEED FIFTY UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US $50.00).
